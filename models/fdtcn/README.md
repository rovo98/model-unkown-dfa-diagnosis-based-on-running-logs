## NOTICE


1. These models using Temporal convolution layers. And I use the keras implementation by [philipperemy](https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn) rather than using the original one (provided by the author of [An Empirical Evaluation of Generic Convolutional and Recurrent Networks for Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01271.pdf), which is implemented with Pytorch).
2. So, before running these models, please install ``keras-tcn`` as a package in your virtual python environment. Simply following the instruction at the repository [keras-tcn](https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn).
